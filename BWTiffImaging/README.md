# BWTiffImaging
### Universal crop tool with rotate and deskew. Outputs BW Multipage Tiff.

---


* BWTiffImaging - Came across a real world situation where I needed a good document capture with some bells and whistles that would 
   output a decent quality, black and white multipage tiff with a decent output file size. 
   
   Status - Feature Complete, Functional. Needs bit of cleanup and do something with the output like gallery drop.

   Add multiple images, the output will be a Black and White tiff with Fax4 Compression.
