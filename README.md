# Ryon's Toy Box And Demo Repo
### Random landing zone for any and everything!

Will update this as things are added.

* Sunshine Test - App used during Udacity course work by Google. Test Repo Code.

* BWTiffImaging - Came across a real world situation where I needed a good document capture with some bells and whistles that would 
   output a decent quality, black and white multipage tiff with a decent output file size. 
   
   Status - Feature Complete, Functional. Needs bit of cleanup and do something with the output like gallery drop.

* Politipoint - App that uses ProRepublica API to list information about various politicians. 
   Image and color are strictly placeholder. Focused on functionality.
   
   Status - WIP  Direction and design undetermined.
   
* OffBeat - Search Engine query tool to filter out fast food, chains etc. Leaving places possibly otherwise unheard. 
   
   Status - Barley started, design undetermined.
