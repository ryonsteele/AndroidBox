Will update this as things are added.

* Sunshine Test - App used during Udacity course work by Google. Test Repo Code.

* BWTiffImaging - Came across a real world situation where I needed a good document capture with some bells and whistles that would 
   output a decent quality, black and white multipage tiff with a decent output file size. 
   
   Status - Feature Complete, Functional. Needs bit of cleanup and do something with the output like gallery drop.
